how it work
- with your camera take few viedos of punches and kicks
- if ffmpeg is not installed run sudo apt install ffmpeg
- run ffmpeg -i video.mov $filename%03d.jpg
#where video.mov is the name an extension of your videos. 
#this will take couple frame (pictures) of the videos and,
#you'll have your starting dataset
#after you have all this picks you need to classify them in folders
 *Kicks
 *Punches
 *Others(where you're not doing anything or controling the recording etc..) 
- run python3 rename.py
#now we need to rename the files inside folders for convenience purpose.
